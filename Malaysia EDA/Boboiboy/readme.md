## üè†Kuala Lumpur Property Listingsüè†
In this project, we are going to do an exploratory data analysis of the Property Listings in Kuala Lumpur. 

### About Dataset üìä
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dragonduck/property-listings-in-kuala-lumpur
This dataset is a tabular result of scraping a property listing website for properties for sale in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Only the overview page was scraped so individual property details are scarce. 

There are 8 columns and 53.9k records in this dataset:

    1. Location
    The neighborhood in which the property is situated.

    2. Price
    The listed sales price in Malaysian Ringgit (RM).

    3. Rooms
    The number of listed rooms. The format N+M indicates N full bedrooms and M additional rooms that cannot count as such for one reason or another.

    4. Bathrooms
    The number of bathrooms in the property.

    5. Car Parks 
    The number of car parks on the property.

    6. Property Type
    Malaysian properties may fall in one of several property types depending on their characteristics.
 
    7. Size
    The total size of the property. Note that some properties are listed by their land area and others by the built-up size, i.e. the total living space of the property.

    8. Furnishing
    Whether or not the property comes pre-furnished
