## Introduction
For this assignment, we have decided to use the dataset, *Number of Government School Pupils by District Education Office and State 2017-2018* retrieved from Department of Statistics, Malaysia which provides the information regarding the government schools in Malaysia such as the type of school, the school stage and the state, the district education office, year, sex and number of pupils. To analyse this dataset, we will be using the Python language with the help of libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib.

<h2> Conclusion</h2>

From the analysis that we have conducted on the dataset chosen, we can conclude that the Borneo states have the highest amount of schools where Sarawak has a total of 360 schools and Sabah has a total of 288 schools. However, we cannot say the same for the District Education offices as the West Malaysia has dominated the top 10 District Education offices with Petaling Perdana leading with the average of 52157.75. Other than that, it has also been proven by the analysis conducted that the male population are significantly higher than the female population overall especially in the Vocational College. This may occur because men are more prone to do heavy and physical task compared to women.
