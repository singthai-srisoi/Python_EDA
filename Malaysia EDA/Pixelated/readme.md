### Dataset
Dataset taken from Department Of Statistics Malaysia Official Portal<br>
> Popultation & Demography/Death by state, sex and age group, Malaysia, 2001 - 2018<br>
> https://www.dosm.gov.my/v1/index.php?r=column3/accordion&menu_id=amZNeW9vTXRydTFwTXAxSmdDL1J4dz09
 
>To have effective health systems, nations must be aware of the annual death toll and the major causes of those fatalities. Civil registration is the only means to keep track of all deaths and count everyone. Civil registration not only establishes a person's legal identity but also enables nations to pinpoint their most urgent health problems.


>The dataset contains 11040 records and 5 columns of:

    Sex (object) : The gender of the death person (Male or Female)
    Age group (object): The age group of the death person
    Year (int64) : The year of death
    State (object) : The location (States in Malaysia) of death
    Number of deaths (float64) : The total number of deaths occured
    
 >Challenges that had to be faced when analysing this dataset:

    1. Value for Sabah for year 2001-2013 are not published because it is still being studied. However, at the Malaysia level, data for Sabah are included.
    2. Only 1 continuous data was present in this dataset, therefore to extract information we had to use every categorical data present and use them in a way to make the continous data meaningful.
