## Topic: Malaysia Air Pollution Analysis

This project is about Malaysia Air Pollution exploratory data analysis. This dataset contains geolocated data regarding the following pollutants: Nitrogen Dioxide, Ozone, Carbon Monoxide, and Particulate Matter. It enables us to analyze the air pollution levels in Malaysia based on the AQI value and category. 

## Dataset

The dataset consists of AQI values of different pollutants for many cities all over the world. This dataset has 12 columns and 23463 rows. 

The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hasibalmuzdadid/global-air-pollution-dataset">Global air pollution dataset</a>

**global air pollution dataset.csv indicator:**

         Country : Name of the country

         City : Name of the city

         AQI Value : Overall AQI value of the city

         AQI Category : Overall AQI category of the city

         CO AQI Value : AQI value of Carbon Monoxide of the city

         CO AQI Category : AQI category of Carbon Monoxide of the city

         Ozone AQI Value : AQI value of Ozone of the city

         Ozone AQI Category : AQI category of Ozone of the city

         NO2 AQI Value : AQI value of Nitrogen Dioxide of the city

         NO2 AQI Category : AQI category of Nitrogen Dioxide of the city

         PM2.5 AQI Value : AQI value of Particulate Matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less of the city

         PM2.5 AQI Category : AQI category of Particulate Matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less of the city 


<h4>Conclusion</h4>
From the above analysis, the air quality across the vast majority of Malaysia is moderate, or within acceptable limits. However, there may be a risk for some people, particularly those with extreme sensitivities to air pollution. Furthermore, no Malaysian citizen is at high risk because air quality in Malaysian cities does not reach hazardous levels, so no one needs to stay indoors and wear a mask to protect themselves from the pollution.

Looking at the plots for all of the cities above, it is clear that the AQI values in Malaysia are under control, but several cities require immediate action. As a result, there is no such thing as a safe level of air pollution, especially as the AQI approaches 50 and beyond. By learning whether or not the air we breathe is safe and how air pollution can affect our health, we can reduce the negative effects of air pollution on our bodies.
